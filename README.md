## Design

The design of the application is based on the Material Design principles.
The central theme of the application is the simplicity of use. It was aimed to guide the user to the best experience.

### Color Scheme

The color scheme of the application is based on the dark grey and light purple colors:

  ![Color Scheme](documentation/design/color_palette.png)

The decision to use this color palette was made due to the trend in the modern web design.


### Typography

The main font used in the application is Ubuntu. The use of this font is consistent with the color scheme. Needless to say, the Ubuntu font was chosen due to its readability, which increases user experience.

  ![Typography](documentation/design/ubuntu.png)


To emphasize the importance of the text, the font-weight was set to 900. To make the accent on the buttons, the font-weight was set to 700. For the rest of the text, the font-weight was set to 400.

### Imagery

- The main background image was generated with the use of the [BGJar](https://www.bgjar.com/) tool. The image was generated with the following settings:

  ![Background](documentation/design/background_main.svg)

To generate this particular pattern, I used Contour Line Generator with white background and #93D3FD54 as the color of the lines. 


- The main part is allocated to the use of icons from the [font awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website. The use of icons is essential for the user experience when it comes to multifunctional websites.

## Deployment

### Heroku

The website is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed by visiting this [link](https://django-social-network-project.herokuapp.com/).

The process for deploying the website to Heroku is as follows:

1. Create a Heroku account if you don't already have one.

2. Create a new app on Heroku.

    1. Go to the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).
    2. Click on the "New" button.
    3. Click on the "Create new app" button.
    4. Choose a name for your app.
    5. Choose a region.
    6. Click on the "Create app" button.

3. In your app go to the "Resources" tab.

    1. Add a Heroku Postgres database.
    2. Add a Heroku Redis database (heroku may ask you for your credit card details, but won't charge).

4. In your app go to the "Settings" tab, press "Reveal Config Vars", and add the following config vars if they are not already set:

    1. ```ALLOWED_HOSTS``` = your heroku domain name.
    2. ```CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME``` = the cloud name you used when creating your cloudinary account.
    3. ```CLOUDINARY_API_KEY``` = the api key you got when created your cloudinary account.
    4. ```CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET``` = the api secret you got when created your cloudinary account.
    5. ```DATABASE_URL``` = the url of your heroku postgres database.
    6. ```REDIS_URL``` = the url of your heroku redis database.
    7. ```SECRET_KEY``` = a secret key for your app.
    8. ```EMAIL_HOST_USER``` = the email address you going to use to send emails.
    9. ```EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD``` = the password for the email address you are using.
    10. ```DEBUG``` = True during development, False during production.
    11. ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC``` = 1 during development. Remove this when deploying to production.

5. In your app go to the "Deploy" tab.

    1. If it's already possible, connect your Heroku account to your GitHub account and then click on the "Deploy" button.
    2. If not, you need to copy the Heroku CLI command to connect your heroku app and your local repository.

        - ```heroku git:remote -a <your-heroku-app-name>```

6. Go to your local repository.

7. Login to your Heroku account in your terminal and connect your local repository to your heroku app.

    1. ```heroku login -i``` - Enter all your Heroku credentials it will ask for.
    2. Paste the command you copied from step 5 into your terminal.

8. Create Procfile.

    For this project I used Daphne server for its ability to run asynchronous applications, so in my case I had the following Procfile:

    - ```release: python manage.py migrate``` - this command will apply all migrations every time you re-deploy the app.
    - ```web: daphne social_network.asgi:application --port $PORT --bind 0.0.0.0 -v2``` - this command will run the app.
    - ```worker: python manage.py runworker -v2 channel_layer``` - this command will run the worker for the channel layer to run the async tasks.

9. Create ```requirements.txt```. This can be done by running the following command:

    - ```pip freeze > requirements.txt```
    or
    - ```pipreqs requirements.txt``` - if you have pipreqs installed.

10. Add and commit all changes.

11. Push your changes to Heroku.

    - ```git push heroku master```
    or
    - ```git push heroku main```

12. Check the logs of your app in heroku dashboard and make sure everything is working.

13. After the development is done, you can change the ```DEBUG``` config var to ```False``` and remove the ```DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC``` config var from the config vars on heroku.


### Local Deployment

1. Clone the repository.

    - ```git clone https://github.com/lexach91/Django-social-network-PP4.git```

2. Go to the ```Django-social-network-PP4``` directory.

    - ```cd Django-social-network-PP4```

3. Create a virtual environment.

    - ```python3 -m venv venv```

    - ```source venv/bin/activate```

4. Install all dependencies.

    - ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

5. Create a ```env.py``` file.

    - ```touch env.py```

6. Add the following lines to ```env.py```:

    - ```import os```
    - ```os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]``` = your secret key.
    - ```os.environ["DEBUG"]``` = "True" or "False" depending on whether you are in development or production.
    - ```os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"]``` = "True" or "False" depending on whether you are in development or production.
    - ```os.environ["ALLOWED_HOSTS"]``` = your domain name.
    - ```os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]``` = your database url.
    - ```os.environ["CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME"]``` = your cloudinary cloud name.
    - ```os.environ["CLOUDINARY_API_KEY"]``` = your cloudinary api key.
    - ```os.environ["CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET"]``` = your cloudinary api secret.
    - ```os.environ["REDIS_URL"]``` = your redis url.

7. Create and migrate the database.

    - ```python manage.py makemigrations```
    - ```python manage.py migrate```

8. Create the superuser.

    - ```python manage.py createsuperuser```

9. Run the server.

    - ```python manage.py runserver```

10. Access the website by the link provided in terminal. Add ```/admin/``` at the end of the link to access the admin panel.


P.S. If you are using Gitpod, you can skip steps 1-3 by clicking this [link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/lexach91/Django-social-network-PP4), and start from step 4.
